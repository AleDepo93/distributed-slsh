This repository contains the code for my Master's thesis on Distributed Stratified Locality Sensitive Hashing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, within group ALFA.
I was supervised by Dr. O'Reilly, Dr. Hemberg and Prof. Hofmann at ETH Zurich.

Please refer to the thesis, appendices A and B, for the documentation.

Part of this work led to the following publication:
"Distributed Stratified Locality Sensitive Hashing for Critical Event Prediction in the Cloud", De Palma, Hemberg, O'Reilly.
At NIPS 2017 Workshop on Machine Learning for Health.
